Auto generated slave data

Files:
1. drt_rom_file.txt: example drt data file (using the DRT in the simulation is
  not implemented yet)
2. project_defines.v: a dependency file that is used primarily for DRT (not
  used right now)

3. tb_wishbone_master.v: main entry point for the code, this is the testbench
  used to exercise the code, it behaves as both a stimulus and and
  input/output interface to the wihbone master

4. SConstruct: MAIN CONTROL point
	-'scons': compiles generated slave files
	-'scons sim': runs a simulation based on the "master_input_test_data.txt"
	-'scons wave': opens up GTK wave and loads the current simulation
	-'make clean': clean everythin up

5. command_file.txt: a list of files that are fed into the Makefile to generate
  the simulation, some of the files will be the same used in an actual project
  (example: wishbone_main.v)

6. wave_script.tcl: a TCL script that is fed into gtkwave in order to load up
  the signals, feel free to modify this in order to add your own signals at
  start up

7. master_input_test_data.txt: this is the bus stimulus, it will behave
  similar to a real design input/output handler, you can ping the master,
  send data to/from peripheral or memory slaves. Example of the commands
  available are written below

Simulation notes:

-Sometimes you need to view waveforms but you don't want to have to keep
  reloading 'make wave' because you may have manually added signals, the best
  practice I've found is to always have the gtkwave window open, and in the
  command window run 'make' then 'make sim' and then in your gtkwave press
  <ctrl + shift + r> and the signals will be reloaded

-iVerilog is amazing, but it does have its flaws, I've found that iVerilog
  will let a lot of errors go that are caught by Xilinx's PlanAhead but this
  will get your code VERY far


Examples:
  Ping:
    00000000:00000000:XXXXXXXX:XXXXXXXX
      -Number of 32-bit values: 00000000 + 1 = 1

      -Device:  Don't Care:     XX
      -Address: Don't Care:     XXXXXX
      -Data:    Don't Care:     XXXXXXXX

  Write 1 32-bit value (01234567) to device 1 address 0:
    00000000:00000001:01000000:01234567
      -Number of 32-bit values: 00000000 + 1 = 1
      -Command: Write (1):      00000001
      -Device:  01              01
      -Address: 0x04            000000
      -Data:                    01234567

  Write 4 32-bit values (1's, 2's, 3's, 4's) to device 2 start address 4
    (will auto increment the address to 7)
    00000003:00000001:02000004:11111111
    22222222
    33333333
    44444444

      -Number of 32-bit values: 00000003 + 1 = 4
      -Command: Write (1):      00000001
      -Device:  02              02
      -Address: 0x04            000004
      -Data:                    11111111 22222222 33333333 44444444

  Read 1 32-bit value from device 3 address 2
    00000000:00000002:03000002:00000000

      -Number of 32-bit values: 00000000 + 1 = 1
      -Command: Read (2):       00000002
      -Device:  03              03
      -Address: 0x02            000002
      -Command Padding          00000000

  Read 8 32-bit values from device 4 address 6
    00000007:00000002:04000006:00000000

      -Number of 32-bit values: 00000007 + 1 = 8
      -command: Read (2):       00000002
      -Device:  04              04
